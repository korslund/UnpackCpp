  /* A stream factory that writes files to a file system directory.
     Directories will be created as necessary. Fully implements all
     UnpackBase necessities:

     - calling open() on a filename returns a writable stream to the
       file path base/name.

     - calling open("") throws an exception, as does any other file
       error. The stream itself may also throw exceptions on error.

     - all necessary nested subdirectories are created before opening
       the file

     - paths ending in / or \ are accepted. They will create the
       directory (if it doesn't already exist), then return an empty
       StreamPtr.

     - no other case returns an empty StreamPtr
